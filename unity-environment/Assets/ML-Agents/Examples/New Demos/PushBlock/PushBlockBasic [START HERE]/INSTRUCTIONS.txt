1. After the TFSharp plugin is installed, from the editor select the Brain
2. Choose BrainType>Internal
3. Drag the PushBlockBasic tensorflow trained model into the Graph Model box
4. Click the play button.
*You should be seeing agents moving around now* 
5. Click the play button again to stop the scene.


How to train this scene:
1. Select the brain
2. Choose BrainType>External
3. Click File>Build Settings
4. In the Build Settings windows click "Add Open Scenes"
5. Uncheck any other scenes in the Build Settings scene list. We just want the PushBlockBasic scene.
6. Select the correct Target Platform. I'm training on a Mac so I choose Mac OS X.
7. Click Build & save the file in the python directory in the cloned repo.
8. You now have a built application of PushBlockBasic in your python directory. Time to train.
9. Open a terminal/cmd prompt and browse to the python dir in this repo. You should see the app we just built.
10. Run this command:

python learn.py PushBlockBasic --train --max-steps=5e5 --summary-freq=500 --batch-size=4096 --buffer-size=8192 --time-horizon=64

*A window should pop up with our scene. You should see the agents moving around*

11. Watch the Mean Reward. Once it gets to ~ 0.90 you can press ctrl-c. A tensorflow model will be saved in the python>models>ppo folder. It will have the name of the app you built. Mine is called PushBlockBasic.
12. Drag this trained model file into your unity project folder.
13. Select the brain
14. Choose BrainType>Internal
15. Drag your trained model file into the Brain>Graph Model box.
16. Click the play button.
*You should be seeing agents moving around now* 
17. Click the play button again to stop the scene.
